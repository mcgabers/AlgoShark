This document provides comprehensive engineering guidelines for developing the AI-Native Business Funding Platform. It serves as a reference for the development team to ensure consistency, efficiency, and high-quality outcomes throughout the project lifecycle. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to build a robust, scalable, and secure platform that meets user needs and business objectives.

2. Development Principles

2.1 Agile Methodology
Iterative Development: Adopt an agile approach with short development cycles (sprints) to incorporate feedback and adapt to changes quickly.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
User-Centric Design: Focus on delivering value to users by prioritizing features based on user feedback and analytics.
2.2 Design Thinking
Empathize with Users: Understand user needs through research and user testing.
Define Problems Clearly: Articulate user problems to guide solution development.
Ideate Solutions: Encourage brainstorming and collaboration to generate innovative ideas.
Prototype Rapidly: Build prototypes to test concepts quickly.
Test and Iterate: Use feedback to refine solutions continually.
2.3 Clean Code and Maintainability
Readability: Write code that is easy to read and understand.
Modularity: Break down code into reusable components and modules.
Documentation: Comment code appropriately and maintain up-to-date documentation.
Refactoring: Regularly improve code structure without changing its functionality.
2.4 Scalability and Performance
Horizontal Scaling: Design systems that can scale out by adding more nodes.
Load Balancing: Distribute workloads evenly across servers.
Asynchronous Processing: Use non-blocking operations where appropriate.
Caching: Implement caching strategies to reduce load times.
3. Architecture Guidelines

3.1 Layered Architecture
Presentation Layer: User interface components built with React.js and Next.js.
Business Logic Layer: Application logic implemented in Node.js (Express.js).
Data Access Layer: Interactions with databases and external services.
Blockchain Layer: Integration with Algorand blockchain for smart contracts and transactions.
3.2 Microservices Architecture
Service Separation: Divide the application into independent services (e.g., user service, project service, transaction service).
Communication: Use RESTful APIs or gRPC for inter-service communication.
Fault Isolation: Ensure failures in one service do not impact others.
Scalability: Scale services independently based on demand.
3.3 API Design
RESTful Principles: Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Versioning: Implement API versioning to manage changes.
Authentication and Authorization: Secure APIs with OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
Error Handling: Standardize error responses with clear messages and codes.
Rate Limiting: Protect APIs from abuse by limiting the number of requests.
3.4 Data Management
Database Choice: Use PostgreSQL for relational data and Redis for caching.
Data Modeling: Normalize data schemas and use indexing for performance.
Data Security: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures.
3.5 Integration Patterns
Event-Driven Architecture: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication.
Webhooks: Implement webhooks for real-time updates from third-party services.
Adapter Pattern: Use adapters to integrate with external APIs, allowing for flexibility.

API Design: Adhere to RESTful principles; use consistent endpoint structures.
Security: Sanitize all inputs; use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Performance: Optimize database queries; use pagination for large datasets.
6. User Interface Development

6.1 Layout and Design
Fixed Viewport Height: Implement a fixed viewport height (100vh) for the main application container.
- Root layout must use min-h-screen to ensure minimum full viewport height
- All pages must maintain full viewport height using h-screen
- Prevent content overflow using flex flex-col and proper overflow handling
- Inner content areas should use flex-grow to fill available space

Three-Column Layout: Implement the fixed three-column layout with an icon-only menu in the first column.
- Main container must use grid layout with fixed height (h-screen)
- Columns must extend full height using h-full
- Implement proper overflow-y-auto on scrollable sections while maintaining fixed height

Responsive Design: Ensure UI adapts to various screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
Consistent Components: Use native Shadcn components for all UI elements to maintain consistency.

6.2 Layout Structure Example

6.2 Styling with Tailwind CSS
Utility Classes: Leverage Tailwind's utility-first approach for rapid UI development.
Custom Configurations: Extend Tailwind's default configuration when necessary but keep custom CSS minimal.
Component Styling: Encapsulate styles within components; avoid global CSS where possible.
6.3 Accessibility
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
Color Contrast: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for text and background contrast.
Alt Text: Provide descriptive alt text for all images and icons.
ARIA Roles: Use ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility.
6.4 Internationalization (i18n)
Language Support: Design the UI to support multiple languages.
Locale Files: Store translatable strings in separate locale files.
Date and Number Formatting: Use locale-aware formatting functions.
